# Snitch-Ecommerce

### Here’s an updated description with a focus on front-end functionality:

---

The Snitch website clone is a front-end design project built from scratch, focused on replicating the look and feel of a functional e-commerce site. Created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features responsive design elements like a dynamic menu, a loading screen, and interactive "add to cart" and "add to wishlist" buttons. The single product page displays items from a product array, though without full interaction on detail pages, as the emphasis is currently on front-end design.

Moving forward, the goal is to expand front-end functionality to include essential e-commerce features. Planned enhancements involve adding product filtering, sorting, search functionality, pagination, and interactive user feedback—such as tooltips, popups, and live cart updates. The project remains front-end focused, offering a hands-on opportunity to learn the ins and outs of building a fully interactive e-commerce experience from scratch.

The Snitch website clone is a front-end e-commerce project crafted from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focused on replicating the look and feel of a functional e-commerce site. The design includes a responsive layout with interactive elements like a dynamic menu, a loading screen, and basic “add to cart” and “add to wishlist” buttons. A product array is displayed on a single product page, though detailed product pages are currently styled only for design purposes without interactive functionality.

While primarily a static front-end project at this stage, the goal is to enhance it with full e-commerce functionality. Planned front-end features include product filtering, sorting, search, pagination, and user-friendly interactions, like popups, live cart updates, and tooltips. With a focus on the front-end, this project offers an in-depth opportunity to learn advanced e-commerce functionality, creating a realistic, interactive shopping experience without back-end integration.
